# GetCleanData
Repo for Getting and Cleaning Data course project

The main thing here is the run_analysis.R script, which will:

Load the HAR-dataset and clean it up by:
- merging training and testing data sets
- adding variable names to dataframe columns
- tidying variable names
- adding subject info and activity info
- by creating a tidy dataset which includes the averages of the variables for each subject and activity ID
